-- Objective:
-- Analyze the cleaned data to identify meaningful trends, correlations, and patterns that reveal how agricultural productivity relates to wildlife population decline and biodiversity loss across regions.

-- Key Actions:
-- * Calculate average crop yiels by region and year to observe productivity trends.
-- * Compare yield growth rates with species population changes.
-- * Identify regions achieving high productivity while minimizing biodiversity loss.
-- * Use correlation and ranking queries to highlight significant patterns and contrasts.
