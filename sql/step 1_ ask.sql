-- Business Task:
-- The main goal of this project is to identify the relationship between agricultural land use, species population decline, and regional agricultural productivity. 
-- This analysis aims to highlight how human-driven farming expansion affects biodiversity and how certain regions achieve higher productivity while maintaining wildlife balance.

-- Key Questions:
-- 1. How does agricultural land expansion correlate with wildlife population decline across regions?
-- 2. Which regions have improved food productivity while reducing habitat loss?
-- 3. What trends link crop yield improvements to biodiversity conservation worldwide?
