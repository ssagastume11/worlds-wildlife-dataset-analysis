-- Objective:
-- To communicate key insights on how agricultural productivity relates to species population trends and regional biodiversity loss, using visualizations and narrative summaries that make your findings clear and actionable.

-- Key Actions:
-- Create visualization that highlight trends, comparisons, and patterns (e.g., line charts for trends over time, bar charts for rankings, pie/stacked charts for distributions).
-- Use aggregated summaries (totals, averages, decade splits) to give context before diving into detail.
-- Highlight key takeaways in plain language, such as: "Sub-Saharan Africa shows steady yield growth despite biodiversity challenges" of "Europe maintains above-median productivity with lower habitat loss."
-- Build a dashboard (in Looker Studio, Tableau, or similar) to make results interactive and easier to explore.
-- Ensure clarity and storytelling: emphasize not just what happened but also why it matters.
